Perfect 👍 You now wrote the correct version!
Let me explain it step by step like for a beginner:

Problem Recap

We want to remove all occurrences of a given value (val) from an array (nums) in-place.
👉 "In-place" means don’t create a new array. Instead, modify the existing one and return the length of the "new" valid array.

Two Pointers Idea

We use two pointers:

fast pointer → scans every element in the array (loop index).

slow pointer → keeps track of the position where the next "good" element (not equal to val) should go.

Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough
int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
    int slow = 0, n = nums.size();

    for (int fast = 0; fast < n; fast++) {
        if (nums[fast] != val) {
            nums[slow] = nums[fast];
            slow++;
        }
    }
    return slow;
}

Example Walkthrough

Suppose:
nums = [3, 2, 2, 3, 4]
val = 3

Initial:

slow = 0

fast = 0

Iteration 1: (fast = 0)

nums[fast] = 3, which equals val.
❌ Do nothing.

Iteration 2: (fast = 1)

nums[fast] = 2, not equal to val.
✅ Copy nums[fast] to nums[slow].
nums[0] = 2
slow = 1

Now array looks like: [2, 2, 2, 3, 4]

Iteration 3: (fast = 2)

nums[fast] = 2, not equal to val.
✅ Copy nums[fast] to nums[slow].
nums[1] = 2
slow = 2

Array: [2, 2, 2, 3, 4]

Iteration 4: (fast = 3)

nums[fast] = 3, equals val.
❌ Do nothing.

Iteration 5: (fast = 4)

nums[fast] = 4, not equal to val.
✅ Copy nums[fast] to nums[slow].
nums[2] = 4
slow = 3

Array: [2, 2, 4, 3, 4]

Final:

slow = 3 → this is the new length of the array.

Modified array (first slow elements): [2, 2, 4]

✅ All 3s are removed.

Key Beginner Takeaways:

fast → checks every number.

slow → marks where to put the next valid number.

The part of the array after slow doesn’t matter, because the problem only cares about the first slow elements.
