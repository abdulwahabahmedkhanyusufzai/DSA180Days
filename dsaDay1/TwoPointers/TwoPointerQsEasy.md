Got it üëç ‚Äî let‚Äôs carefully **re-organize your problem list** so that each problem maps to the correct **two-pointer variant** based on the definitions from our cheatsheet.

Here‚Äôs the cleaned-up and **updated variant map**:

---

# üß© Two Pointers Problem Map

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Opposite Ends Pointers (Classic Two-Pointer)

Used when comparing elements from **both ends**.

* 125. Valid Palindrome >>
* Palindrome Linked List 
* Strobogrammatic Number 
* Reverse String >>
* Reverse Vowels of a String >>
* Valid Palindrome II >>
* Reverse Only Letters >>
* Squares of a Sorted Array >>
* Reverse Prefix of Word >>
* Lexicographically Smallest Palindrome >>
* Minimum Average of Smallest and Largest Elements  >>

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Same Direction Pointers (Index Scan / Linear Walk)

Both pointers move **forward**, often with filtering / skipping logic.

* 27. Remove Element >>
* Move Zeroes >>
* Is Subsequence >>
* Valid Word Abbreviation
* Long Pressed Name >>
* Check If String Is a Prefix of Array>>
* Find First Palindromic String in the Array>>
* Find All K-Distant Indices in an Array>>
* Apply Operations to an Array>>
* Find the Array Concatenation Value
* Find Indices With Index and Value Difference I

üö® **Correction:**

* **Backspace String Compare ‚Üí belongs to *Parallel Arrays (Two Sequences)***, not Same Direction.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Fast & Slow Pointers (Cycle / Middle Detection)

One pointer moves faster (used in cycle detection, middle finding).

* 141. Linked List Cycle
* Intersection of Two Linked Lists
* Happy Number
* Middle of the Linked List

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Partitioning Problems (Multiple Pointers / In-Place Rearrangement)

Use 2‚Äì3+ pointers to partition into regions.

* 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
* Merge Sorted Array (‚ùå actually **Merging** ‚Üí move it)
* Move Zeroes (already listed above, Same Direction)
* Sort Array By Parity
* Sort Array By Parity II
* Duplicate Zeros

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Merging / Parallel Arrays (Two Sequences)

Classic **merge two sorted sequences** or traverse in parallel.

* 88. Merge Sorted Array
* Intersection of Two Arrays
* Intersection of Two Arrays II
* Assign Cookies
* Minimum Common Value
* Merge Two 2D Arrays by Summing Values
* ‚úÖ Backspace String Compare (fits here better than Same Direction)

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ String Specific Variants (Two-Pointer but string-oriented tricks)

* Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String
* Reverse String II
* Reverse Words in a String III
* DI String Match
* Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence
* Merge Strings Alternately

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Pair / Sum Problems (Opposite Ends on Sorted Arrays)

* 170. Two Sum III
* Two Sum IV - Input is a BST
* Two Sum Less Than K
* Check If N and Its Double Exist
* Find the Distance Value Between Two Arrays
* Largest Positive Integer That Exists With Its Negative
* Count Pairs Whose Sum is Less than Target

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Miscellaneous (Don‚Äôt fit neatly, but still pointer-style)

* Count Binary Substrings (group counting ‚Üí windowing)
* Shortest Distance to a Character (two passes)
* Flipping an Image (row-wise 2-pointer reverse)
* Remove Palindromic Subsequences (palindrome check inside)
* Faulty Sensor
* Maximum Enemy Forts That Can Be Captured
* Count the Number of Incremovable Subarrays I
* Earliest Finish Time for Land and Water Rides I
* Flip Square Submatrix Vertically

---

‚úÖ Now everything matches our **Two Pointers Master Cheatsheet** variants.
Biggest correction: **Backspace String Compare belongs under Parallel Arrays (Two Sequences)**.

Do you want me to also build a **single consolidated master table (Variant ‚Üí Problems)** like the recap in your cheatsheet, so you have one clean reference page?
